# LM35_With_Arduino_Uno
This project uses LM35 temperature sensor to get the temperature of the surrounding. If the temperature of the surrounding is greater than 30 degree Celsius, the built-in LED will blink for every 500 milliseconds else if it is lesser than 30 degree Celsius, the built-in LED will blink every 250 milliseconds.
